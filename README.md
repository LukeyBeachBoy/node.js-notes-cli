# node.js-notes-cli

## What is it?
This is a small project I made during my learning of the Node.js ecosystem. It uses Yargs to parse input from the commandline and call appropriate functions in response.

## Functionality
With this app you can:
  - Add a note
  - Read specific note
  - List all notes
  - Remove a note
  
## Usage
- After cloning, navigate to the cloned directory from the commandline and run 'npm i' to update the dependencies.
- To run the app, simply run 'node app.js --[command]', replacing [command] with the function of your choice.
- To see all commands run 'node app.js --help'
